# Problem 8.34

$$ \text{Standard deviation } (\sigma_{\hat{p}}) = 0.0354 $$

$$ P(\hat{p} < 0.40) = 0.0082 $$  
$$ P(0.43 < \hat{p} < 0.57) = 0.9802 $$  
$$ P(\hat{p} > 0.54) = 0.1141 $$

### Interpretation
1. There’s only about a **0.82%** chance that less than 40% will be boys.  
2. There’s a **98%** chance that between 43% and 57% will be girls.  
3. There’s an **11.5%** chance that more than 54% will be boys.

$$ \text{Mean of sampling distribution } (\mu_{\bar{X}}) = 12 $$  
$$ \text{Variance of sampling distribution } (\sigma^2_{\bar{X}}) = 5.4 $$  
$$ \frac{\sigma^2}{n} = 5.4 $$  

### Interpretation
The population of student credit hours at Metropolitan Technological College has an average of **12 hours** with moderate variation.  
When we take samples of size 2 (with replacement), the mean of all possible sample means remains **12**, confirming that the sample mean is an **unbiased estimator**.  
However, the spread of these sample means is smaller (**variance = 5.4**) than the original population (**variance = 10.8**), showing that averaging reduces variability and makes sample means more reliable indicators of the true population mean.
